# Project Description
This project demonstrates basic JavaScript programming concepts such as filtering arrays, finding prime numbers, and performing mathematical operations. It includes two scripts: `app.js` and `index.js`.

## Scripts Overview

### `app.js`
- **Purpose**: Identifies prime numbers from a given array and performs operations on the primes.
- **Features**:
  1. Filters prime numbers from the array.
  2. Finds the maximum and minimum prime numbers.
  3. Calculates the sum of the prime numbers.

### `index.js`
- **Purpose**: Separates numbers into even and odd categories.
- **Features**:
  1. Filters even and odd numbers from the array.
  2. Logs the results in a comma-separated format.

## Code Answers

### `app.js`
#### Prime Numbers in the Array:
[19, 23, 13, 31, 29, 2, 11, 17, 5]

#### Maximum Prime:
31

#### Minimum Prime:
2

#### Sum of Primes:
150

### `index.js`
#### Even Numbers in the Array:
[2, 20, 14, 12, 8, 6, 4, 10, 16, 18]

#### Odd Numbers in the Array:
[3, 7, 15, 9, 5, 1, 11, 19, 17, 13]

## Expected Output

### `app.js`
```
Prime Numbers: [ 19, 23, 13, 31, 29, 2, 11, 17, 5 ]
Maximum Prime: 31
Minimum Prime: 2
Sum of Primes: 150
```

### `index.js`
```
Even Numbers: 2, 20, 14, 12, 8, 6, 4, 10, 16, 18
Odd Numbers: 3, 7, 15, 9, 5, 1, 11, 19, 17, 13
```

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the root directory.
3. Execute the scripts using Node.js:
   - For `app.js`: `node app.js`
   - For `index.js`: `node index.js`

## Conclusion
This project serves as a basic exercise in JavaScript to manipulate arrays and perform mathematical operations. It demonstrates filtering, array transformations, and formatted outputs in the console.
